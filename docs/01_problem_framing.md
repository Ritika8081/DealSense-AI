# Problem Framing: SkyGeni Sales Intelligence

## What is the Real Business Problem?

SkyGeni’s sales leadership is focused on win rate, but the true business problem is deeper: **sales cycles have lengthened by 30%, slowing revenue recognition and threatening growth targets.** While win rates are volatile but not declining, deals are taking longer to close, which delays revenue and increases risk. The challenge is not just about closing more deals, but closing them faster and more efficiently, with a focus on the segments and behaviors that drive revenue velocity.

## 6-7 Key Questions an AI System Should Answer for the CRO

1. Which deals are at highest risk of stalling or being lost, and why?
2. What are the main drivers of win rate and sales cycle length across segments (rep, industry, region, deal size)?
3. Which sales reps or teams need targeted coaching to improve efficiency?
4. How do lead sources and deal stages impact conversion and velocity?
5. Where are the biggest bottlenecks in the sales process?
6. What is the optimal deal size and segment focus for maximizing revenue?
7. How can we predict and prevent pipeline slippage before it impacts targets?

## 4-5 Metrics That Matter Most (Including 2 Custom)

1. **Win Rate (%)** – Proportion of deals won out of total closed.
2. **Average Sales Cycle (days)** – Time from opportunity creation to close.
3. **Pipeline Velocity Score (PVS)** *(Custom)* – $\text{PVS} = \frac{\text{Total Won ACV}}{\text{Avg Sales Cycle Days} \times \text{Total Deals}}$
4. **Rep Efficiency Index (REI)** *(Custom)* – $\text{REI} = \frac{\text{Win Rate} \times \text{Avg Deal Size}}{\text{Avg Sales Cycle}}$
5. **Deal Quality Index** – Composite score based on lead source, stage progression, and historical conversion.

## Assumptions About Data/Business


Additional assumptions for robust analysis:
- Sufficient historical volume of opportunities (e.g., multiple quarters, thousands of deals) to support pattern detection.
- Closed-lost reasons and basic competitor fields are populated at least partially, so the AI can learn drivers of loss, not just win.
